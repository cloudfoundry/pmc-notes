# Runtime PMC Meeting 2016-02-09

## Agenda
* Announcements
* PMC Lifecycle Activities
* Backlog Review

## Announcements
- decision for CF final release candidate SHA now happens via issues in a [Foundation repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-final-release-election) and involves PMs and anchors from all teams contributing to the core.
- Amit proposes to make this repo publicly viewable (main risk is we need to be careful when discussing CVEs in relation to approving/disapproving a candidate SHA)
- Release notes have a section on Job Spec Changes; Amit is asking PMs to contribute to this section when they contribute to the rest of the release notes.
- This policy seemed acceptable to the attendees at the 2016-01-26 meeting, but that group did not constitute a quorum. Those present decided to revisit the discussion at this meeting.

## PMC Lifecycle Activities

## Discussion

## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies Köper

### Garden - Will Pragnell

#### Garden-Linux

#### Guardian (OCS/runC)

### Greenhouse - Steven Benario

### Diego - Eric Malm

- Added rep bulk loops to BBS benchmark tests; 200K apps across 1000 reps too much for etcd 
	- Spiking on solutions: relational datastore for BBS, in-memory cache of ActualLRPs
	- Relational store looks promising, will benchmark against HA deployment of CF MySQL release
- Auctioneer changed to distribute in-flight container starts more evenly
- Adding logging, metrics to determine whether the route-emitter's routing table ever maps two instances to the same ip:port
- Documenting and publicizing team tooling to deploy BOSH+CF+Diego to AWS
- Switched CI to run CATs instead of DATs; will remove DATs after next CF final release
- Finished substantial refactor of code that holds locks and presence in consul
- Will install BOSH-delivered trusted certs in cflinuxfs2 rootfs, provide to all Linux containers

### Routing - Shannon Coen

### MEGA - Amit Gupta

#### Infrastructure (Consul, etcd, NATS, Postgres)
* lots of improvements to robustness of consul and etcd releases
* lots of refactoring consul to remove more logic out of bash
* lots of refactoring consul-acceptance-tests and etcd-acceptance-tests to isolate tests from external dependencies
* onboarding two new team members

#### Release Integration (cf-release, integration pipelines)
* separated out several credentials repos to mitigate risks associated with leaks
* continued work to merge DATS into CATS
* significant progress on route-registrar agent component, supporting sophisticated health check configuration, preparing handoff to routing team
* cut up to release v230
* lots of issues, questions, and PRs
* lots of pipeline maintenance, especially with shepherding through CVE fixes

### Runtime OG - Michael Fraenkel

### Loggregator - Jim Campbell

* Finishing up Doppler->Metron TCP (to go with previouly released TLS)
* Working on Metron throughput 

### UAA - Sree Tummidi

### CAPI - Dieu Cao
- Continuing to make progress on support for Tasks.  Currently fixing up auditing, quotas, and orphan mitigation.
- Continuing work on v3 and application process types
- Very experimental new api docs for v3 can be viewed [here](http://v3-apidocs.cloudfoundry.org)
- Work on replacing the nfs included in cf-release with webdav for the default blobstore is nearly complete and should be available in a soon to be available cf-release.
  - Instructions for required manifest changes described [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PDswakRCBdnQEbJYZa01Fo8vo3DC6h3rtP3sckcp5Eo/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Will no longer support nfs included in cf-release, but will continue to support externally provided nfs
  - The blobstore release is still a single point of failure and we recommend not using it for environments requiring HA of all components.

### PERSI - Ted Young

### Networking? - Evan Ferrar
