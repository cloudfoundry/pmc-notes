* CF Feature Roadmap Review


## Announcements


## PMC Lifecycle Activities

 - Project Eirini (Pluggable Scheduler) Incubation Proposal 

## Discussion


## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Abby Chau


### Garden - Julz Friedman

 - Containerd track going very well, rapidly approaching MVP (containerd for container create/delete, direct runc for processes exec, ready for experimental production testing)
 - Discussions ongoing with bpm around how to support garden's plugin model with bpm (blocking Rootless, for now, since this is required for cf-networking integration)
 - Hopefully fixed the wave of bugs discovered by grootfs becoming the default (awaiting more feedback, but seems like it!). Assuming this proves stable for a while longer we will start thinking about a timeline to EOL garden-shed.
 - Identified and fixed some CVEs around disk quotas when loading docker images (https://www.cloudfoundry.org/blog/cve-2018-1277/)
 - Started discussions with Diego around experiments on what things we can do to make the cpu metrics/sharing story for CF better 

### Garden-Windows - A William Martin


### Diego - Eric Malm

- Continuing to investigate BBS API changes to support maintaining routability of app instances when cells lose presence temporarily
- Declarative healthchecks no longer experimental, now the default in cf-deployment
- Adjusted BOSH DNS alias for the BBS to prevent brief unavailability of BBS during rolling deploys when DNS health-checking is enabled
- Task placement rejections result in task-changed events in the Task event stream
- Reduced volume of route-emitter component logs
- Updated to Golang v1.10.2, but may downgrade to Golang v1.9.6 until [issue #24590](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/24590) is fixed
- lager/chug package now parses new prettier lager log format


### Routing - Shubha Anjur Tupil

- Routing [release 0.176.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/routing-release/releases). GDPR changes for routing (disable logging IPs in HTTP Headers and Source IP, and fixing minor issues)
- Istio 
  - We were able to run the BookInfo demo using Envoy as the edge router and Pilot in the control plane
  - Working on supporting context paths for routing (create/map/unmap/delete routes with context paths)
  - Inception this week on assessing Scaling the Istio/Envoy routing control plane. We hope to come out with an assessment of risks and mitigations and how we can push this to production to learn from real world scnearios


### Infrastructure - Evan Farrar

#### `consul-release`


#### `bosh-bootloader` (a.k.a `bbl`)


### Release Integration - David Sabeti

#### `cf-deployment`


#### `cf-deployment-concourse-tasks`


#### `cf-acceptance-tests`


#### `cf-smoke-tests`


### postgres-release - Valeria Perticara
- Removed deprecated property `databases.databases.[n].run_on_every_startup` and documented how to use hooks to obtain the same result
- Improved serviceability (added timestamps to pre-start; removed traces by default and added option `databases.enable_trace` to enable them)
- Enabling backup/restore through bbr

### HAProxy - Geoff Franks


### MySQL - Marco Nicosia


### Loggregator - Adam Hevenor


### UAA - Sree Tummidi


### CAPI - Zach Robinson


### Services API - Matthew McNeeney
- Asynchronous binding support submitted as PR to CAPI
- Still working through asynchronous unbinding support (and edge cases)
- Planning on starting work on [Improving Service Access in Cloud Foundry Application Runtime](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_OBnFCsL3ru43PEXocsCc3EuGaM0YLHjr0iAoXnakt4) proposal soon


### Permissions - Christopher Brown


### PERSI - Julian Hjortshoj


### Container Networking - Usha Ramachandran


### Bits-Service - Simon Moser

- finished up bits-go implementation to feature parity (Bits-service 2.0). Facing some issue appearing on bosh.io still, but code is done
- worked with relInt, PWS and BLuemix to pick up the 2.0 and started troubleshooting issues (e.g. incorrect retry behaviour caused some staging troubles occasionally) 
- started to implement async upload in bits-go for furhter performance optimization

## CF Feature Roadmap Review



Delivered When? | What?
------|------
*Recently Completed* |
|| - Released service instance sharing (CLI and SAPI) and service account authorization (CLI and UAA)
|| - Fetching service instances and bindings (Services API)
||
*Soon* | **cf-deployment GA:**
|| - Start of 2 month deprecation period for cf-release ([proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KLl4UIQbl92SvYom4fO-LcEoMK1D45KmjA988MwnOR4/edit?usp=sharing))
|| - CF Release Integration team helping community to migrate
|| - CredHub credential generation & rotation for CF components
|| - Ensure route integrity via instance-identity credentials (Diego, Routing, Garden)
|| - Garden will stop requiring root privileges, begin clock on ending support for privileged containers
|| - Use layered filesystems instead of streaming-in for droplets (expected to lead to performance improvements especially for use cases involving large droplets)
|| - Async service binding creation and deletion (Services API)
|| - Droplet upload, variable substitution, and BOSH release (CLI)
||
*Next* | - GrootFS (OCI-compliant rootfs downloader)
|| - Server side app manifest (CAPI, CLI)
|| - Zero-downtime app updates (CAPI, Diego)
|| - Deprecation of Consul for management plane service discovery (Infrastructure, RelInt, BOSH)
||
*Future* | - Improve reliability of placing large-footprint app instances with less system capacity (Diego)
||

*Above are plans, not commitments, and may change without notice.*
