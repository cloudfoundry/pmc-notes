## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Abby Chau

- Released CF CLI v6.35.2 with clearer services authorization warning message when a service has been disabled for the organization; releasing CF CLI v6.36.0 soon
- Continue cross-team pairing with CAPI on server side app manifest
- Completed Droplet Upload feature
- Started BOSH release for CF CLI
- Started app manifest variable substitution

### Garden - Julz Friedman


### Garden-Windows - A William Martin

- Support for Windows Server Containers and Windows 2016 is GA in cf-deployment as of v1.22.0!
- Exploring garden.Process.Attach() to support Windows-based Concourse workers.
- Started exploration of containerD support in collaboration with Garden team.
- Started exploration of necessary networking features to support C2C networking for Windows-hosted apps. 
- Fixed a bug in the new launcher that broke Windows environment variables that contain values with newlines.


### Diego - Eric Malm

- Diego components can opt into more readable lager logs
- Identified issue with graceful shutdown of Envoy listeners; filed [envoy #2920](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/2920)
- Added more specific advice on Diego component scaling and performance tuning
- Tightened default cipher suites, MACs, and key exchange algorithms for CF SSH
- Starting work to improve resilience of Task placement to insufficient resources
- Exploring ways to maintain routability of app instances when cells lose presence


### Routing - Shannon Coen
- Working towards enabling [HTTP routing through edge envoy](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/151465691)
- Next milestone - [TLS termination for downstream clients at edge envoy](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/154672458)


### Infrastructure - Evan Farrar

#### `consul-release`


#### `bosh-bootloader` (a.k.a `bbl`)



### Release Integration - David Sabeti

#### `cf-deployment`
- Windows2016 ops-files have been promoted out of experimental.

#### `cf-deployment-concourse-tasks`
- There is now a version of each task that uses Credhub instead of the vars-store. The first step towards purging the vars-store from the cf-deployment workflow.

#### `cf-acceptance-tests`
- No updates.

#### `cf-smoke-tests`
- Release (finally) includes version tags.


### postgres-release - Valeria Perticara


### HAProxy - Geoff Franks




### MySQL - Marco Nicosia


### Loggregator - Adam Hevenor
- We are nearly GA on our work for [log-cache](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/log-cache)
- Reviewed the cf log-cache plugin to discuss the deprecation strategy of endpoints log-cache is replacing
- We are working on the ability to get on-demand service metrics into the cache
- We have lined up the work to implement issolated loggregator (leveraging log-cache)

### UAA - Sree Tummidi

- Cut UAA releases v56 containing forward feature development including:
  - MFA working with CF CLI
  - Cut UAA releases v52.8 and v45.8 for JDK updates
- We are ready to apply for OpenID certification!
- Will start work on encryption of MFA Creds in UAA DB



### CAPI - Zach Robinson

- Working on server side application manifests
- Working with routing on istio integraton for routing
- Incepting on zero downtime app deployments
- Completed named service bindings

### Services API - Matthew McNeeney

- Fetching route service configuration parameters is in the latest CF deployment
- Still working on asynchronous binding and unbinding
- We're developing a broker proxy application for Google's hosted service broker that handles their special authentication flow


### Permissions - Christopher Brown

- Migration track done (for now)
- Experimenting with HA database configurations
- Performing some API and database changes before adding experimental ops file to cf-deployment

### PERSI - Julian Hjortshoj


### Container Networking - Usha Ramachandran
- Introduced and fixed a [CVE](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/blog/cve-2018-1267/) in silk-release that was introduced as part of adding multiple interface support. cf-networking-release is not affected. 
- Working on multiple interface support for the Softlayer CPI, we had to revert the changes to apply ASGs on multiple interfaces due to the CVE
- silk-release is running on PWS using experimental ops files, next we will modify cf-deployment to use silk-release. cf-networking-release 2.0 and silk-release 1.0 will be released after this
- The team started working on our first [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1498342/stories/156282604) to add Envoy to the data path for c2c traffic


### Bits-Service - Simon Moser


## CF Feature Roadmap Review



Delivered When? | What?
------|------
*Recently Completed* | 
|| - Released service instance sharing (CLI and SAPI) and service account authorization (CLI and UAA)
|| - Fetching service instances and bindings (Services API)
||
*Soon* | **cf-deployment GA:**
|| - Start of 2 month deprecation period for cf-release ([proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KLl4UIQbl92SvYom4fO-LcEoMK1D45KmjA988MwnOR4/edit?usp=sharing))
|| - CF Release Integration team helping community to migrate
|| - CredHub credential generation & rotation for CF components
|| - Ensure route integrity via instance-identity credentials (Diego, Routing, Garden)
|| - Garden will stop requiring root privileges, begin clock on ending support for privileged containers
|| - Use layered filesystems instead of streaming-in for droplets (expected to lead to performance improvements especially for use cases involving large droplets)
|| - Async service binding creation and deletion (Services API)
|| - Droplet upload, variable substitution, and BOSH release (CLI)
||
*Next* | - GrootFS (OCI-compliant rootfs downloader)
|| - Server side app manifest (CAPI, CLI)
|| - Zero-downtime app updates (CAPI, Diego)
|| - Deprecation of Consul for management plane service discovery (Infrastructure, RelInt, BOSH)
||
*Future* | - Improve reliability of placing large-footprint app instances with less system capacity (Diego)
||

*Above are plans, not commitments, and may change without notice.*
