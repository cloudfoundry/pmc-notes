ðŸŽ‰ Merged two PRs from the community! Both should be released soon!
* [Gorouter #282](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/gorouter/pull/282) makes sure that the gorouter does not sometimes return a 502 (a server error) when a client disconnects. Now it only returns 499s (a client error). Thank you @randomtask1155 for your contribution!
* [Gorouter #284](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/gorouter/pull/284) enables the gorouter to retry on more types of failures as long as the request is deemed idempotent. The rules for idempotency were taken from the Go standard library. This means that gorouter now respects the `Idempotency-Key` and `X-Idempotency-Key` headers. Thank you @peterellisjones for your contribution!
