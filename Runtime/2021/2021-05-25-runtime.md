## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Alex Berez
- Getting ready for the next minor release


### CAPI - Seth Boyles
* Cloud Controller now attempts a [graceful shutdown when healthcheck fails](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-release/pull/195)
* Fixed issue with [inconsistent ordering on paginated endpoints](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng/issues/2249)
* Work continues on [Space Application Supporter](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cfar-proposals/issues/22) role
* Initial discussions and investigations on [migrating Cloud Controller off of Thin](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng/issues/2254)

### Services API - Miguel Luna


### UAA - Jeremy Morony


### Garden - Julz Friedman


### Eirini (incubating) - Giuseppe Capizzi
* Continuing the work on on stabilising our CRD-based API
* Completed an [investigation](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/eirini-release/issues/207) about the impact of using `Deployment`s instead of `StatefulSet`s

### Windows Containers - Kartik Lunkad


### Diego - Amin Jamali


### Volume Services - Julian Hjortshoj


### Networking - Amelia Downs
üêõ Bug Fix: We stopped 2 jobs that run on the TCP Router VM from taking ports that overlap with recommended TCP Router ports.
* Fixed `system-metrics-agent` job in `system-metrics-release` in [v2.0.12](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/system-metrics-release/releases/tag/v2.0.12).
* Fixed `loggr-udp-forwarder` job in the `loggregator-agent-release` in [v6.0.3](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator-agent-release/releases/tag/v6.0.3).
* These jobs were claiming any available ephemeral port for their /debug endpoints. If a user tried to make a TCP route with a port in use, then the TCP Router would silently stop loading any new config and would stop working for all new ports.

üöå Prioritization update: We have decided to prioritize bumping to nats 2.x in nats-release. This would provide great performance benefits. See [issue here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nats-release/issues/26).

### HAProxy - Geoff Franks


### Logging and Metrics - Ben Fuller


### Release Integration - Andrew Wittrock


### KubeCF (incubating) - Jan Dubois
* further improvements to bpm emulation, making most drain scripts work without patches.
* we have a new Concourse instances that mostly works; still some issues with update tests to resolve.

### Infrastructure - Preethi Varambally

#### `bosh-bootloader` (a.k.a `bbl`)


### postgres-release - Valeria Perticara


### MySQL - Marco Nicosia
