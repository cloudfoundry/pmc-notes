- Upcoming: We will remove the `x509ignoreCN=0` go flag from [gorouter](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/routing-release/blob/2c59f53f2a5eb7ad6b798ff2f5d6452fbc1c5178/jobs/gorouter/templates/bpm.yml.erb#L11).
  - This flag was introduced in [golang 1.15.0](https://golang.org/doc/go1.15#commonname) in order to deprecate the "legacy behavior of treating the CommonName field on X.509 certificates as a host name when no Subject Alternative Names are present".
  - Without this flag, all clients that present certificates to gorouter must have the SAN match the hostname.
  - Cf-deployment has already taken care of all of the certs that it controls in [14.0.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/releases/tag/v14.0.0) and [15.0.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/releases/tag/v15.0.0).
