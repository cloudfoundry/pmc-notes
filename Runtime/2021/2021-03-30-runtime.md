## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Zach Robinson

### Eirini (incubating) - (vacant)


### Windows Containers - Kartik Lunkad

### Networking - (vacant)
- Upcoming: We will remove the `x509ignoreCN=0` go flag from [gorouter](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/routing-release/blob/2c59f53f2a5eb7ad6b798ff2f5d6452fbc1c5178/jobs/gorouter/templates/bpm.yml.erb#L11).
  - This flag was introduced in [golang 1.15.0](https://golang.org/doc/go1.15#commonname) in order to deprecate the "legacy behavior of treating the CommonName field on X.509 certificates as a host name when no Subject Alternative Names are present".
  - Without this flag, all clients that present certificates to gorouter must have the SAN match the hostname.
  - Cf-deployment has already taken care of all of the certs that it controls in [14.0.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/releases/tag/v14.0.0) and [15.0.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/releases/tag/v15.0.0).

### KubeCF (incubating) - Jan Dubois

Focused project goal to:

>KubeCF provides a certified Cloud Foundry experience on kubernetes using bosh releases deployed by helm.

- Released [2.7.13](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubecf/releases/tag/v2.7.13), fixing upgrade issues.
- Deprecating support for Eirini (unless there are volunteers, Eirini will be stuck at Eirini-1.8, and be removed if it blocks updating cf-deployment).
- Deprecating support for sle15; it will be removed when we add support for cflinuxfs4.
- Preparing for 2.8 release, including a bump to cf-deployment-16.9.0.
