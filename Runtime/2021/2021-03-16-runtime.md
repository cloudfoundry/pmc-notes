[haproxy-boshrelease 10.3.0 has been released](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/haproxy-boshrelease/releases/tag/v10.3.0)

# Fixes
- Fix soft reload which stopped working with the switch to BPM 1.1.9 and the addition of the feature that allowed HAproxy to log to stdout, which requires launching in foreground.

# New Features
- Switch to [master-worker-mode](https://www.haproxy.com/de/blog/haproxy-process-management/) to allow `reload` to work with `nbproc > 1`
